BREAKTHROUGH: Module loading issue resolved. Root cause was malformed
variable reference in error message within ConvertFrom-DiceExpression.ps1
(line 60: $currentIndex: $remainâ€¦ instead of $currentIndex: $remaining).

CURRENT STATE: Module now loads successfully via dot-sourcing from any
directory. All six core functions operational without errors:
- Get-RandomNumber: Base RNG functionality working
- Invoke-DiceRoll: Single die rolls working
- Invoke-MultipleDiceRoll: Multiple dice with individual results
- Invoke-PercentageRoll: d% rolls with 00=100 handling (needs refinement)
- ConvertFrom-DiceExpression: Parser operational but needs refinement
- Invoke-DiceExpression: Complex expression evaluation working

NEXT STEPS: Create feature branch for dice system refinements. Priority:
1. Fix ConvertFrom-DiceExpression regex pattern and edge cases
2. Refine Invoke-PercentageRoll for true d% behavior (tens/ones dice)
3. Add comprehensive error handling and input validation
4. Implement proper testing suite for percentage and expression parsing

DEV NOTE: Percentage roll needs true 2d10 behavior where first die
represents tens (0-9) and second die represents ones (0-9), with
00 interpreted as 100. Current implementation may need adjustment.

Using dot-sourcing during development (. ./bagOfDice.psm1) bypasses
PSModulePath restrictions. Will switch to standard Import-Module for
production release after feature branches are completed and tested.
