BREAKTHROUGH: Module loading issue resolved. Root cause was malformed
variable reference in error message within ConvertFrom-DiceExpression.ps1
(line 60: $currentIndex: $remainâ€¦ instead of $currentIndex: $remaining).

CURRENT STATE: Module now loads successfully via dot-sourcing from any
directory. All six core functions operational without errors:
- Get-RandomNumber: Base RNG functionality working
- Invoke-DiceRoll: Single die rolls working
- Invoke-MultipleDiceRoll: Multiple dice with individual results
- Invoke-PercentageRoll: d% rolls with 00=100 handling
- ConvertFrom-DiceExpression: Parser operational but needs refinement
- Invoke-DiceExpression: Complex expression evaluation working

NEXT STEPS: Create feature branch for dice expression parser refinement.
Current parser works but needs improved regex pattern and better error
handling for edge cases. Focus on supporting complex expressions like:
"2d4+1d8+2", "3d6-1", and nested operations.

DEV NOTE: Using dot-sourcing during development (. ./bagOfDice.psm1)
bypasses PSModulePath restrictions. Will switch to standard Import-Module
for production release after feature branches are completed and tested.

Human developer note: look into that d% roll, it should not be able to roll
00 and 100.
