# Statement of Work: BagOfDice Module Development Project

## Project Overview
**Project Name:** BagOfDice PowerShell Module Development  
**Project Manager:** Darius Whiteplume  
**Development Team:** DeepSeek AI Assistant  
**Evaluation Context:** Comparative analysis of AI coding assistance capabilities  

## Project Objectives
1. Develop three interdependent PowerShell modules for tabletop gaming utilities
2. Implement complex dice notation parsing and evaluation system
3. Create robust error handling and user reporting mechanisms
4. Document development process for AI assistance evaluation study
5. Establish patterns for AI-human collaborative development workflow

## Technical Scope
### Module 1: BagOfDice
- Dice rolling utilities (single, multiple, percentage rolls)
- Complex expression parsing (e.g., "2d4+1d8+2")
- Detailed roll reporting and visualization
- Pipeline support and error handling

### Module 2: BagOfGems (Future)
- Gemstone generation using dice module
- Table-based lookups and property assignment
- Economic valuation systems

### Module 3: TreasureHoard (Future)
- Treasure generation system
- Integration with BagOfGems
- Multiple treasure types and rarities

## Development Methodology
### Daily Cycle Protocol
- **Morning Briefing:** "Start our day" command initiates development session
- **Progress Tracking:** Continuous commit history and change documentation
- **Evening Report:** "End our day" command generates progress summary
- **Roadblock Tracking:** **ROADBLOCK** tagging for persistent issues

### Communication Framework
- Manager provides strategic direction and intervention points
- AI handles implementation details and code generation
- Regular status reporting through conversation history
- Explicit acknowledgment of limitations and constraints

## Current Status (Feature Branch: rewrite-dice-expressions)
### Active Development
- Implementing new parsing methodology for dice expressions
- Solving tokenization issues with operator preservation
- Building detailed reporting system with verbose output
- Addressing variable parsing issues in error messages

### Recent Roadblocks
- **Parser Ambiguity:** Resolved operator vs dice expression conflict
- **Variable Syntax:** Addressed `$variable:` parsing errors multiple times
- **Mobile Development Constraints:** Working within phone interface limitations

## Success Metrics
### Technical Delivery
- Clean, functional code meeting specifications
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Proper PowerShell module structure and conventions
- Complete documentation and examples

### Process Evaluation
- Effective AI-human collaboration patterns
- Appropriate manager intervention points
- Roadblock resolution efficiency
- Mobile development workflow effectiveness

## Constraints & Limitations
- **Real-time Limitation:** No persistent memory between sessions
- **Interface Constraints:** Mobile-only development environment
- **Evaluation Focus:** Process documentation takes priority over speed
- **Scope Management:** Focus on core dice functionality before expansion

## Next Phase Priorities
1. Complete dice expression parser implementation
2. Implement comprehensive error handling
3. Develop verbose reporting system
4. Prepare for BagOfGems module integration
5. Document all design decisions and roadblocks

This project serves dual purposes: delivering a functional PowerShell module suite while providing valuable research data on AI-assisted development workflows under constrained conditions.

**Project Status:** ACTIVE  
**Current Phase:** Core dice parsing implementation  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (parser complexity, mobile constraints)
