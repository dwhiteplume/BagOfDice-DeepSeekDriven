at this point all functions seem to be working when imported through
individual files and including the $script:Random in the import file.
there was an issue with one file which DeepSeek could not figure out
after several prompts some with web access and some with DeepThink.
i suggested the file split and by doing so found the invalid function.
an issue still exists at this point so I have added Write-Verbose
checks including the necessary advanced function features.
